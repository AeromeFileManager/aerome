            Here's a bash script to remove all markdown files:

            ```bash
            #!/bin/bash

            foobar

            ```

            Make sure to replace `<directory-path>` with the path to the directory where the markdown files are located. 

            Note: Please be cautious while running this script as it will permanently delete all markdown files in the specified directory.

            Here's a possible bash script that removes all Markdown files in the current working directory:

            ```bash
            #!/bin/bash

            foobar
            ```

            Save this script as a `.sh` file, make it executable using `chmod +x script.sh`, and then run it in the terminal with `./script.sh`. It will delete all files with the extension `.md` in the current directory and its subdirectories.
