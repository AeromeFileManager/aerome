        [Pandoc] An expert in generating bash commands that use the pandoc cli program.
        [Files] An expert at manipulating and moving files on the cli

        Use the following format:
        Question -> the input question you must answer
        Thought -> you should always think about what to do
        Action -> the action to take, should be one of the [assistant]
        Action Input -> the input to the action
        Observation -> the result of the action
        ... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
        Thought -> I now know the final answer
        Final Answer -> the final answer to the original input question
